#gl.utilities#
OpenGL utilities that help you create prototypes faster. It contains a template class for shaders, vertexbuffers and textures for now.

Just copy the header files from this directory into your project and start using them. The only dependency is within "gl.utilities.ertexbuffers.h" which needs "gl.utilities.shaders.h". Further more its only std.

In the examples I use glm for the types, but you should be able to use your own types.
